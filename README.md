# Crun

> A simple script to run cpp files easier and faster (using g++)

I realy had a fool problem with my favorite IDE to comile and run cpp files 
so i wrote this script for my own! It may help others who have same problem :)

## How to use

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/amiremohamadi/Crun && cd Crun
  ./crun.sh YOURFILE.cpp  # Or the/place/of/YOURFILE.cpp (./crun.sh -m file1.cpp -m file2.cpp -m file3.cpp)
  ```
  
 ## TODO
 
 - [X] Compile and run multiple cpp files
 - [ ] Add more features (or bugs!)
